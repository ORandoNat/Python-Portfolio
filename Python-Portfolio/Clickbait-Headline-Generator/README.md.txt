# 📰 Clickbait Headline Generator — Satirical Content Machine

A Python-based headline generator that hilariously mimics clickbait content farms. Users can generate randomized, over-the-top headlines using pre-defined templates and lists of trendy nouns, locations, and internet tropes. Perfect for practicing string formatting, randomization, and program structure — with a side of humor.

## 😂 Overview

Create mock headlines like:
- *Are Millennials Killing the Chicken Industry?*
- *You Won’t Believe What This Texas Robot Found in Their Attic!*

The program randomly selects headline templates and fills in the blanks using lists of nouns, places, states, and pronouns to keep things ridiculous and varied.

## 🛠️ Features

- Generates 1 to N unique clickbait-style headlines
- Multiple headline formats built on reusable functions
- Satirical social media and site references at the end
