# 🖼️ Bitmap Message Generator

A fun and artistic Python script that prints custom messages onto a visual bitmap. Each character in the bitmap is replaced with letters from a user-defined message, forming a stylized text portrait. Originally crafted by Al Sweigart, this project merges programming with ASCII art.

## ✨ Project Description

Enter a short text message and watch it mapped across a predefined bitmap image. Each asterisk (`*`) or non-space character in the bitmap gets replaced with a character from your message, cycling through the message characters repeatedly to fill the pattern.

This project is a great introduction to string manipulation, loops, and modular formatting in Python.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- ASCII bitmap rendering
- String indexing and modulo operations
- Looping and pattern matching
- Artistic terminal output

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive message input
- Bitmap-to-text mapping using cyclic character replacement
- Easy customization of the bitmap pattern
- Beginner-friendly design with clearly commented code

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `sys` module for input validation and script termination

## 🧪 Learning Highlights

- Practiced string splitting and nested loops
- Used modulo arithmetic for cycling through message characters
- Explored ASCII art generation and custom formatting
- Reinforced control flow and input handling

## 💡 Customization Ideas

- Replace bitmap with your own ASCII design for themed messages
- Enhance with color using third-party libraries like `colorama`
- Export output to a text file or PDF for artistic sharing
- Refactor into a function to allow batch generation or integration into other tools
- Add unit tests for message rendering to support future QA processes

## 📦 How to Run

```bash
python bitmap_message.py
```

Enter your message when prompted and enjoy the personalized artwork!
